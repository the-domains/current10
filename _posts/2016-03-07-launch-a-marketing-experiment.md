# **Launch - A Marketing Experiment**

**Launch**is an experiment that will be exploring the beginning stages of this website. Beginning with the week long beta test, we will be displaying the performance and metrics used for organic, paid and social traffic techniques we activate with this website.

Since one of the categories of this site is online services, we will be exploring different tools and their features throughout this experiment.  We are launching this website (January 25, 2016) with only a handful of articles and will drip feed content over the first 30 days observing different tactics, slowly introducing different content types from ranking pages, news articles, reviews, videos, guides and how-to's.

Check back with this page periodically or subscribe to our Newsletter to follow along and explore different techniques with us as we move forward.

## Beta week

December 1-7
